### Start a study session in 2 seconds 

Study Files Bot is a command-line application designed to help students efficiently manage and access study materials associated with their courses. The application allows users to register subjects, link relevant documents and URLs, and open these resources directly in a web browser. Key features include listing available subjects, viewing associated files, and adding or modifying study materials.

The project is primarily aimed at university students who want to streamline their study processes by quickly accessing digital resources related to their coursework.

# Setup Instructions ðŸ›  

### 1. Download and Configure
- Download the project files to your local machine.

### 2. Create a .bat File
- Create a batch file (e.g., `study.bat`) that calls the Python script. Ensure that the file is located in a directory that you want to easily access from the command line.

### Add the .bat File to Environment Variables
To run the `study.bat` file from any command prompt, add its directory to your system's environment variables:
1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer and select 'Properties.'
2. Click on 'Advanced system settings' and then 'Environment Variables.'
3. In the 'System variables' section, find and select the **Path** variable, then click **Edit.**
4. Add the path to the directory where you saved your `study.bat` file.

### 3. Add Python to Environment Variables
If Python is not already in your environment variables, youâ€™ll need to add it:
1. In the same 'Environment Variables' window, locate the **Path** variable.
2. Click **Edit** and add the path to the directory where Python is installed (e.g., `C:\Python39\` or wherever your Python executable is located).
3. Ensure that the **Scripts** folder (e.g., `C:\Python39\Scripts\`) is also included in the **Path**.

### 4. Run the Application
- Open a command prompt and use the command `study "subject_name"` to access your study materials.
